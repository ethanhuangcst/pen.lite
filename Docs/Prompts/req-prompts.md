# Feature: Default Prompt for All Users

## User Story 1: Default Prompt Definition
As a Pen user
I want a default prompt to be available for all users
So that I have a starting point for AI interactions without needing to create my own prompt

### Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: Default Prompt is loaded from default_prompt.md
  Given the application is running
  And default_prompt.md exists in the same folder as KeyChain
  When the application initializes
  Then it should load the default prompt from default_prompt.md
  And it should assign a special ID (e.g., DEFAULT) to the default prompt
  And the special ID should be defined as a constant, not hard-coded
  And the default prompt should be available for all users


## User Story 2: Default Prompt Cannot Be Deleted
As a Pen user
I want the default prompt to always be available and not deletable
So that I always have a fallback prompt option

### Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: Default Prompt is displayed at the top of the prompts list
  Given the user is logged in
  And the user navigates to Preferences - Prompts tab
  When the prompts list loads
  Then the default prompt should be displayed at the top of the list

Scenario: Delete button for Default Prompt is disabled
  Given the user is logged in
  And the user navigates to Preferences - Prompts tab
  When the prompts list loads
  Then the delete button for the default prompt should be disabled
  And mouse hover over the delete button should show a tooltip indicating "Default prompt cannot be deleted"
  And the edit button for the default prompt should be enabled

Scenario: Attempting to delete Default Prompt shows error
  Given the user is logged in
  And the user navigates to Preferences - Prompts tab
  When the user attempts to delete the default prompt
  Then it should display an error message: "Default prompt cannot be deleted"
  And the default prompt should remain in the list

Scenario: Default Prompt is created when registering a new user
  Given the user is not logged in
  And the user is on the New User Registration screen
  When the user successfully completed the registration
  Then the system should automatically create the default prompt for the user
  And the prompt ID = Prompt.DEFAULT_PROMPT_ID



## Technical Requirements

1. **Default Prompt ID**: Use a constant for the special ID (e.g., DEFAULT) instead of hard-coding
2. **File Location**: default_prompt.md should be placed in the same folder as KeyChain: pen/mac-app/Pen
3. **UI Behavior**: Default prompt should always appear at the top of the prompts list with disabled delete button
4. **Error Handling**: Attempts to delete the default prompt should be rejected with an appropriate error message
5. **New User Onboarding**: Default prompt should be automatically created for new users
6. **Fallback Mechanism**: If default_prompt.md is missing, a predefined default prompt should be created

## Default Prompt Structure

The default_prompt.md file should contain:
- Prompt name: A clear, descriptive name for the default prompt
- Prompt content: A well-crafted prompt that provides a good starting point for AI interactions

Example structure:
```
# Default Prompt Name

## Prompt Content
Your default prompt content goes here. This should be a versatile prompt that works well for general AI interactions.
