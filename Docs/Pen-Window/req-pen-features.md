- AC2. Pen window remains active and focused.
- AC3. Settings window stays open if it was open before Pen window opened.

#### Scenarios
Scenario F1-US1-S1: Close non-Pen windows on Pen window open (except Settings)

## F2. Input Mode and Clipboard Intake

### US1. Switch between auto-copy mode and manual-edit mode
As a Pen user, I want to switch between auto-copy mode and manual-edit mode, so that I can choose whether source text comes from clipboard or from my own draft.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- AC1. `pen_footer_auto_switch_button` toggles between Auto mode and Manual mode.
- AC2. In Auto mode, source text view is `pen_original_text_text`.
- AC3. In Manual mode, source text view is `pen_original_text_input`.
- AC4. Mode switch updates only input-mode-related UI and does not change selected prompt/provider.

#### Scenarios
Scenario F2-US1-S1: Switch from Auto mode to Manual mode
  Given Pen is running
  And Pen window is open
  And input mode is Auto
  When user toggles `pen_footer_auto_switch_button` to Manual
  Then input mode becomes Manual
  And `pen_original_text_input` is shown as source input view
  And `pen_original_text_text` is hidden as source input view
  And prompt and provider selections remain unchanged

Scenario F2-US1-S2: Switch from Manual mode to Auto mode
  Given Pen is running
  And Pen window is open
  And input mode is Manual
  When user toggles `pen_footer_auto_switch_button` to Auto
  Then input mode becomes Auto
  And `pen_original_text_text` is shown as source input view
  And `pen_original_text_input` is hidden as source input view
  And prompt and provider selections remain unchanged

### US2. Persist selected input mode across logout and app restart

- AC2. After user logout and next login, Pen restores the last saved input mode.
- AC3. After app quit and relaunch, Pen restores the last saved input mode.
- AC4. If saved mode is unavailable or invalid, Pen falls back to Auto mode.

#### Scenarios
Scenario F2-US2-S1: Restore saved mode after logout and login
  Given Pen is running
  And user has selected Manual mode
  And mode preference is saved
  When user logs out and logs in again
  Then Pen window starts in Manual mode

Scenario F2-US2-S2: Restore saved mode after app relaunch
  Given user has selected Auto mode
  And mode preference is saved
  When user quits and relaunches Pen app
  Then Pen window starts in Auto mode

Scenario F2-US2-S3: Fallback to Auto mode on invalid saved value
  Given mode preference storage contains an invalid mode value
  When Pen window launches
  Then input mode is set to Auto

### US3. On switch to auto mode, load clipboard text and preserve manual draft
As a Pen user, I want Auto mode to immediately refresh source text from clipboard without losing my manual draft, so that I can freely move between both workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- AC2. Existing text in `pen_original_text_input` is preserved and not overwritten.
- AC3. Clipboard validation and fallback behavior follow existing clipboard rules.
- AC4. In Auto mode, enhancement source uses `pen_original_text_text`.

#### Scenarios

  Given Pen is running
  And Pen window is open
  And input mode is Manual
  And `pen_original_text_input` contains draft text A
  And system clipboard contains text B
  When user toggles mode to Auto
  Then `pen_original_text_text` is updated from clipboard text B
  And `pen_original_text_input` still keeps draft text A
  And enhancement source is `pen_original_text_text`

### US4. On switch to manual mode, clear enhanced text and restore manual draft
As a Pen user, I want Manual mode to reset enhanced output and restore my draft, so that I can continue editing without stale enhancement results.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- AC1. Switching to Manual mode clears `pen_enhanced_text_text`.
- AC2. After clearing, `pen_enhanced_text_text` shows default hint text: "Enhanced text will appear here".
- AC3. Switching to Manual mode restores previously saved text in `pen_original_text_input`, if any.
- AC4. If no saved manual draft exists, `pen_original_text_input` starts empty and editable.
- AC5. In Manual mode, enhancement source uses `pen_original_text_input`.
- AC6. In Manual mode, enhancement can be triggered by either `Cmd+Enter` or clicking the send button.
- AC7. In Manual mode, pressing Enter without Command inserts a new line and does not trigger enhancement.
